# JoSAA_project
Program to fetch data from josaa and similar websites

Steps to follow:
--> Visit "Opening and Closing Ranks" page on josaa.nic.in or csab.nic.in
--> Once you have your required table displayed, run the script in `console.js` in browser's console.
(This will fetch all the displayed data from browser and will save it as a JSON file)
--> Place the generated `table.json` file in `sources` folder. (make sure to rename it to follow the conventions)
--> Accordingly edit the path in `json_to_excel.js` and run it.
DONE!!!
